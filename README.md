# 100DaysOfSwiftUI


## WeSplit

First project is an introduction to the basic concept of SwiftUI. We learn how creating form, addition of the NavigationBar, creating views in loop, handling of pickers, among others.


## LengthConversion

Useful challenge that allows to use the concepts learned during the lessons. 
I choose the length conversion: users choose meters, kilometers, feet, yards, or miles.
To complete this challenge, I use the [How to convert units using Unit and Measurement](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-units-using-unit-and-measurement) article, which is from Paul Hudson.
